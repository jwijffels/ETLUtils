Title: Utility Functions to Execute Standard Extract/Transform/Load Operations (using Package 'ff') on Large Data
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Jan Wijffels
Description: Provides functions to facilitate the use of the 'ff' package in
    interaction with big data in 'SQL' databases (e.g. in
    'Oracle', 'MySQL', 'PostgreSQL', 'Hive') by allowing easy importing directly into 'ffdf'
    objects using 'DBI', 'RODBC' and 'RJDBC'. Also contains some basic utility
    functions to do fast left outer join merging based on 'match', factorisation of data and a basic
    function to recode vectors.
